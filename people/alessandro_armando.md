## Short Bio

Alessandro Armando is professor at the <a href="http://www.unige.it">University of Genova</a>, where he received his Laurea degree in Electronic Engineering in 1988 and his Ph.D in Electronic and Computer Engineering in 1994. His appointments include a postdoctoral research position at the University of Edinburgh (1994-1995) and one as visiting researcher at INRIA-Lorraine in Nancy (1998-1999).

He has been co-founder and director of the <a href="http://www.ai-lab.it">Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI-Lab)</a> at <a href="www.unige.it">DIST</a> (2003-2011), of the <a href="http://st.fbk.eu">Security and Trust Research Unit</a> at the <a href="http://cit.fbk.eu">Center for Information Technologies</a> of <a href="http://www.fbk.eu">Bruno Kessler Foundation</a> in Trento (2010-2016), and of the Computer Security Laboratory (CSec) at [DIBRIS](http://www.dibris.unige.it). He is co-founder of the [Talos](http://www.talos-sec.com), a spin-off of DIBRIS focused on Cybersecurity.

He has been founder and director (Presidente del Comitato di Gestione) of the [Master Universitario di II Livello on ``Cyber Security and Data Protection''](http://www.mastercybersecurity.it) of the University of Genova for the academic years 2014/2015 and 2016/2017.

He has contributed to the discovery of <a href="http://www.ai-lab.it/armando/GoogleSSOVulnerability.html">a vulnerability on the SAML-based Single Sign-On for Google Apps</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2012.08.007">an authentication flaw in emerging SSO protocols (namely SAML SSO v2.0 and OpenID)</a>, and <a href="http://www.ai-lab.it/bugAndroid/bugAndroid.html">a vulnerability that leads to a Denial of Service attack on all Android devices</a>. 

His focus is on developing cutting-edge automated reasoning techniques and on using them to build a new generation of push-button software verification and debugging tools supporting the development of complex, large-scale, distributed IT applications.

## Software Tools

I have contributed to the design and/or development of the following
software tools:

- RDL (Rewrite and Decision Procedures Laboratory).  RDL is a fully automatic tool for formula simplification in quantifier-free first-order theories (Linear Arithmetics, Theory of Equality,and their combination).  RDL is based on the Constraint Contextual Rewriting paradigm and features a tight integration of rewriting and decision procedures.  
- TSAT++ is an open platform for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) based on a tight coupling of satisfiability procedures and a SAT-solver.  The current version of TSAT++ supports Separation Logic (also known as Difference Logic).
- The AVISS Tool is a fully automatic security protocol analyser.  It is capable to analyse a large portion of the protocols collected in the Clark \& Jacob library of security protocols. It is the predecessor of the AVISPA Tool.
- The [AVISPA Tool](http://www.avispa-project.org) is a fully automatic analyser for large-scale Internet security-sensitive protocols.  It comprises 4 back-ends implementing a variety of security protocol verification techniques.
- [SATMC (SAT-based Model Checker)](http://www.ai-lab.it/satmc/) is a bounded model checker for security protocols.  SATMC reduces the problem of checking whether a protocol is vulnerable to attacks of bounded length to the satisfiability of a propositional formula which is then solved by a state-of-the-art SAT solver taken off-the-shelf. SATMC is one of the back-ends of the AVISPA Tool.
- The [AVANTSSAR Platform](http://www.avantssar.eu/) is an integrated toolset supporting the formal specification and automated validation of the trust and security of service-oriented architectures.
- The [SPaCiOS Tool](http://www.spacios.eu) is an automated tool that supports security analysts in the security analysis of on-line applications. This is achieved by leveraging several techniques, including formal modeling, abstract attacks detection, and security testing.
- Eureka is a model checker for sequential software (C code) based on the counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) paradigm.  Unlike many other software model checkers based on the CEGAR paradigm Eureka analyses arrays precisely.
- SMT-CBMC is a bounded model checker for sequential software (C code).  SMT-CBMC reduces the problem of checking whether an input program has an execution path of bounded length violating an assertion to the satisfiability of a formula with respect to a decidable theory which is then solved by a state-of-the-art SMT solver taken off-the-shelf.
- BYODroid implements the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) paradigm on Android devices.  This is done by automatically checking mobile applications against the security policy set by the organization.  The innovation potential of BYODroid is witnessed by the following recognitions:
  - BYODroid has been selected (1st place in the ranking) in the Start Cup of the University of Genova, 2013 edition.
  - BYODroid entered the final of the Idea Challenge 2014 of the EIC ICT Labs of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
  - BYODroid has been selected by the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) in the context of the Cyber Security Incubator 2015 Program.
- MAVERIC is a platform for the automatic security analysis and monitoring of mobile applications whose development has been funded by Poste Italiane.  MAVERIC is now routinely used by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of Poste Italiane to monitor and analyze the Poste Italiane mobile apps ecosystem.
