# Rulebook

## Code of conduct

Participants are expected to fully embrace principles of good sportsmanship, to compete fairly and to not try to exploit the game system or the rules in unintended ways.

Please take *fair play* into consideration, expecially when something is not explicitly listed in the rules below.
Whenever the latter is not obvious, jury should be consulted before any action taken.


## Scoring System

The final score is a combination of:

1. challenge solving and
2. reporting, both online and offline.

**Challenge score** is be automatically assigned when a task is completed.
Each task has a score depending on its estimated difficulty (e.g.: 100 for Easy tasks) and the score assigned also takes into consideration the completion time (e.g.: 100 points, minus 1 point for each 10 minutes passed from the beginning of the competition).

**Reporting score** is assigned by the jury.
When the CTF is over, participants hand in a *write-up*, i.e., a report where they summarize their activity during the challenge.
Should an unexpected event occur, participants have to report it. Score is assigned depending on the level of detail of the report.
