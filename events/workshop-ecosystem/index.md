<p align="justify">
Over the years, pervasive computing and communication technologies have fostered new computing paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Mobile Computing. The ubiquity of these paradigms, their expandability, and their applicability in different problem spaces have made them invaluable in modern computing solutions. 
At the same time, however, security becomes a real concern, especially since these systems moved from single, isolated paradigms to complex ecosystems built by the fruitful interactions among several computing paradigms. 
The workshop's primary goal is to discuss the many aspects of security and privacy of emerging software ecosystems, with a specific focus on Mobile, IoT, and Cloud computing platforms. The event focuses on these emerging environments by covering the entire ecosystem lifecycle, from the secure design to the notions of security during development (DevSecOps) and operations (VA/PT and risk assessment).
The workshop hosts four talks:
