*ABSTRACT:* This course has a strong hands-on approach; proficiency in low-level C programming, and familiarity with operating system concepts are a must.
Lectures will contain practical activities, therefore participants need to bring their own Linux laptops and set them up appropriately.

The exam consists in the exploitation of some 32/64-bit programs (a different set for each student), and a subsequent discussion of the used techniques and tools.
