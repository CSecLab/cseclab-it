10:00-11:00: **CISPA – One of Europe’s leading research sites of IT security**
Dr. Sandra Strohbach, Head of Project Office at CISPA

*Abstract:* The public presentation offers an overview of the Center for
IT security, Privacy, and Accountability - CISPA located on the Saarland
Informatics Campus in Saarbrücken, Germany. Founded in 2011, CISPA has
become an important address of IT security and privacy. You can learn
more about the different research areas, excellent education programmes,
and career opportunities. The examples of current research projects
provide an insight into our daily work.

11.30-12.30: **Automated Vulnerability Analysis for Modern Application Software**
Giancarlo Pellegrino, Ph.D., Research Group Leader at CISPA

*Abstract:* The complexity and pervasiveness of application software are growing
rapidly. Nowadays, application software encompasses multiple devices,
e.g., mobile and IoT, and web services to perform operations ranging
from online shopping and managing household appliances to controlling
manufacturing processes. Like any other programs, application software
has vulnerabilities that, when exploited, can be used for financial
fraud, stealing confidential data, and industrial espionage.
Unfortunately, existing automated vulnerability analysis techniques are
inadequate to tackle the complexity reached by these programs, thus
leaving them exposed to attackers. My main research topic intends to
stop this emerging trend and lay the foundation for the next-generation
automated vulnerability analysis techniques.
This talk focuses on the detection power and attack surface coverage
challenges and presents two recent advances in the field. The first part
of the talk presents Deemon, a tool that combines dynamic analysis and
property graphs to mine Cross-Site Request Forgery, a long-neglected
severe vulnerability. The second part of the talk presents jAEk, a new
generation web application crawler that uses JavaScript dynamic analysis
to increase the covered attack surface of web applications by 80%.
